It is a OAuth Project made using Djanog-allauth for social Authentication and OpenId connect . It has different features like sign-in through your social Identity Provider you trust (Google, Apple, Microsoft , X). I also implemented the OpenId Connect Feature which is used by only few companies one of them is Google . So I added OpenId for Only Google . It was Fun solving this problem.
